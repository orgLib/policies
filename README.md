# orgLib's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

At orgLib, we implemented Privacy by Design.  Visit <a href="https://www.orglib.com/why.html" target="_blank">this page</a> to see how.
<br/><br/>Our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are hosted on github so all changes were made from prior versions of 
our policies are transparent to the public.



To have an overview of orgLib policies, visit orgLib's <a href="https://www.orglib.com/privacy.aspx" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and
